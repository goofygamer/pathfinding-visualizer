# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project showcases how different pathfinding algorithms function to connect a starting point to an end point.

## Implementation
1. Wrote the code for A*, Breath-First Search, and Djikstra's algorithms.
2. Built a 25X25 pathway with an initial point, an end point, and a maze that cannot be breached by the code to add some spice to the functionality.
3. Created a frontend GUI with all of the previously mentioned functionality using [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).
## Functionality
